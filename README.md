# auto-attendance
Automatically joins teams meetings and sends a message \n
Haven't added a way to eascape the popup that asks to connect an audio device yet\n
You can mess with the delay statements to speed it up, depends on your internet speed\n
Only works if there's only one meet in each channel, will try to fix that later\n
